Open Web UI Design Specification for Enabling Automation (OUIA)
===================================================================

Welcome to the OUIA specification. The OUIA was designed to assist the
various parties involed in web UI construction
in creating an easy to use, frustration free experience for QE/QA testers. Its core concepts
have been developed over many years and honed in real life experience.
The goal is to impact developers as little as possible by enforcing
standards upstream where possible.

The standard defines a number of responsibilities on:

 * Component/Widget providers
 * Page developers
